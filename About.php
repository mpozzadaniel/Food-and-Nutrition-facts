              <p>Nutrient-rich (or nutrient-dense) foods are low in sugar, sodium, starches, and bad fats.</p>
              <p>They contain a lot of vitamins and minerals and few calories.</p>
              <p>Your body needs vitamins and minerals, known as micronutrients. They nourish your body and help keep you healthy.</p>
              <p>They can reduce your risk for chronic diseases. Getting them through food ensures your body can absorb them properly.</p>
              <p>Try to eat a variety of foods to get different vitamins and minerals.</p>

                <h3> It Is Critical to Avoid a Vitamin D Deficiency</h3>
              </div>
              <h4>Vitamin D is a unique vitamin that actually functions as a hormone in the body.</h4>
              <p></p>The skin makes vitamin D when it is exposed to ultraviolet rays from the sun. This is how people got most of their daily requirement throughout evolution.

              </div>

              <h6>However, a large part of the world is deficient in this critical nutrient today.</h6>
              <p>In many places, the sun simply isn't available throughout most of the year.</p>
              <p>Even where there is sun, many people tend to stay inside and use sunscreen when they go out. Sunscreen effectively blocks vitamin D generation in the skin</p>
              <p>If you're deficient in vitamin D, then you're actually lacking a major hormone in the body. Deficiency is associated with many serious diseases, including diabetes, cancer, osteoporosis and others</p>
              <p>To find out if you are at risk, see a doctor and have your blood levels measured.</p>
              <p>Unfortunately, it may be difficult to get enough vitamin D from the diet.</p>

              <p>If getting more sun is not an option, taking a vitamin D supplement or a tablespoon of cod liver oil each day is the best way to prevent or reverse a deficiency.</p>
              <p>Vitamin
              D is a crucial hormone in the body and many people are deficient in it.
              Reversing a deficiency can have powerful health benefits.</p>
